# TheFirstRuleofCodingClub

is....

A trick question! We're far too free thinking to restrict ourselves with such old-fashioned things as rules. 

Now: this repo is intended as a space for brainstorming about RCC project ideas and related matters. 

This takes place on [wiki](https://github.com/RotmanCodingClub/TheFirstRuleofCodingClub/wiki).

Edit, improve, contribute!
